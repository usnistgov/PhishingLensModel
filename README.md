# phishing-lens-model
Exploratory Brunswickian Lens model of phishing attackee decision-making behavior highlighting personality factors and user work environment context. 

This code implements an exploratory computational model of user decision making in a potential phishing attack scenario. The model demonstrates how contextual factors, such as message subject matter match to current work concerns, and personality factors, such as conscientiousness, contribute to users’ decisions to comply with or ignore message requests. 

It is assumed that readers have a working knowledge of R in order to make use of this code.
